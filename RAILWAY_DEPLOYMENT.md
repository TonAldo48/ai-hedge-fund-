# Railway Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Deploy AI Hedge Fund API to Railway

This guide will help you deploy your AI hedge fund API to Railway for production use.

## Prerequisites

1. **Railway Account**: Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **GitHub Repository**: Your code should be in a GitHub repository
3. **API Keys**: Have your API keys ready for environment variables

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Steps

### 1. Connect to Railway

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign in
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Choose your AI hedge fund repository

### 2. Configure Build Settings

Railway will automatically detect the `railway.toml` configuration:
- **Dockerfile**: `Dockerfile.api`
- **Port**: 8000
- **Health Check**: `/health` endpoint

### 3. Set Environment Variables

In your Railway project dashboard, go to **Variables** and add:

#### Required API Keys:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-deepseek-api-key
FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key
```

#### Optional Settings:
```bash
PORT=8000
HOST=0.0.0.0
PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
```

### 4. Deploy

1. Click **"Deploy"** in Railway
2. Wait for the build to complete (2-5 minutes)
3. Your API will be available at: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`

## üîç Testing Your Deployed API

### Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-app-name.railway.app/health
```

### List Agents
```bash
curl https://your-app-name.railway.app/hedge-fund/agents
```

### Run Analysis
```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-app-name.railway.app/hedge-fund/run-sync" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tickers": ["AAPL"],
    "selected_agents": ["warren_buffett"],
    "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "model_provider": "OpenAI",
    "show_reasoning": true
  }'
```

## üìä API Endpoints

Your deployed API will have these endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | API information |
| `/health` | GET | Health check |
| `/docs` | GET | Interactive API documentation |
| `/hedge-fund/agents` | GET | List available agents |
| `/hedge-fund/models` | GET | List available models |
| `/hedge-fund/run-sync` | POST | Synchronous analysis |
| `/hedge-fund/run` | POST | Streaming analysis |

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### API Keys Protection
- ‚úÖ Never commit API keys to your repository
- ‚úÖ Use Railway's environment variables
- ‚úÖ Rotate keys regularly

### Rate Limiting
- Consider adding rate limiting for production use
- Monitor usage to prevent abuse
- Set up alerts for unusual activity

## üìà Monitoring & Scaling

### Railway Dashboard
- **Metrics**: View CPU, memory, and network usage
- **Logs**: Monitor application logs in real-time
- **Deployments**: Track deployment history

### Auto-scaling
Railway automatically scales based on:
- Traffic volume
- Resource usage
- Response times

### Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Domains**
2. Add your custom domain
3. Configure DNS records as shown

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Resource Limits
Add to your `railway.toml`:
```toml
[deploy]
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
restartPolicyType = "on-failure"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 3

[resources]
memory = "1GB"
cpu = "1vCPU"
```

### Multiple Environments
```toml
[environments.production]
PORT = "8000"

[environments.staging]
PORT = "8000"
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   ```bash
   # Check if Poetry dependencies are correct
   poetry check
   poetry install --dry-run
   ```

2. **Health Check Failures**
   ```bash
   # Test health endpoint locally first
   python app/backend/run_api.py
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

3. **API Key Errors**
   - Verify all required environment variables are set
   - Check API key validity
   - Ensure keys have proper permissions

4. **Memory Issues**
   - Monitor resource usage in Railway dashboard
   - Consider upgrading to higher memory tier
   - Optimize model selection (use lighter models)

### Logs Access
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# View logs
railway logs --follow
```

## üí∞ Cost Optimization

### Railway Pricing
- **Hobby Plan**: $5/month + usage
- **Pro Plan**: $20/month + usage
- **Team Plan**: $100/month + usage

### Optimization Tips
1. **Use lighter models** (gpt-4o-mini vs gpt-4o)
2. **Optimize Docker image** size
3. **Monitor resource usage** regularly
4. **Set up usage alerts**

## üöÄ Production Checklist

- [ ] All API keys configured in environment variables
- [ ] Health check endpoint working
- [ ] Custom domain configured (optional)
- [ ] Monitoring and alerts set up
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented (recommended)
- [ ] Backup strategy for important data
- [ ] Documentation updated with production URLs
